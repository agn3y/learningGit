    <h1>Git and Github</h1>
    <p><code><strong>git add</strong></code> : to add files to stagging</p>
    <p><code><strong>git commit -m "message here"</strong></code>: to commit the change with a detailed text message</p>
    <p><code><strong>git log</strong></code> : to see log of current branch</p>
    <p><code><strong>git log --all</strong></code> : to see log of whole repository</p>
    <p><code><strong>git log -all --oneline : all log in single line</strong></code></p>
    <p><code><strong>git branch</strong></code> : to see list of branch and currently working branch</p> 
    <p><code><strong>git branch "nameHere"</strong></code>: to create new branch</p> 
    <p><code><strong>git branch --delete branch-name</strong></code> : to delete branch</p>
    <p><code><strong>git checkout</strong></code> : to switch branch (multiple use but let's just keep this one for right now)</p>
    <p><code><strong>git merge "branchName"</strong></code> : go to the branch where you want to merge the code with and use comand</p>
    <p><code><strong>git merge --abort</strong></code> : to abort merge operation</p>
    <p><code><strong>git remote show origin</strong></code> : to see with which repo you currently working with</p>
    <p><code><strong>git remote add origin https://github.com/agn3y/learningGit.git</strong></code> : it will connect/set the repository</p>
    <p><code><strong>git branch -M "nameHere"</strong></code> : it will rename the name of branch</p>
    <p><code><strong>git push -u origin main</strong></code> : <br><br>Every first-time we need to use this command after that we will be able to use git push, here "main" is the name of the branch. -u option tells Git to set an upstream branch. It establishes a connection between your local branch and the remote branch, so Git knows where to push or pull changes from in the future. This is the default name for your remote repository. When you clone a repository, Git automatically names the remote repository origin. You can think of it as a shorthand for the URL of the remote repository (e.g., https://github.com/user/repository.git).</p>
    <p>We can push multiple branches using above given command</p>
    <p><code><strong>git clone</strong></code> : to clone repository</p>
    <p><code><strong>git fetch</strong></code> : download the latest changes from the remote repository, but it will not merge or modify your working directory. git fetch gives you the opportunity to inspect the fetched changes before merging them, which can be helpful for reviewing code or checking for potential merge conflicts. after we use this command we need to merge repo by using git merge command</p>
    <p><code><strong>git pull</strong></code> : fetch changes from a remote repository and automatically merge them into your current branch, inshort git pull will auto mate task which is done by fetch and merge</p>
    <p>whenever we use either of them commands we need to define name of the remote repository. something like <code>"origin main"</code></p>
    <p>there is a rule in Git which is not to rewrite or modify history</p>
    <p>when we have made a commit by accident or may be we sometime just want to revert the change which are not pushed on repository yet we can use <code><strong>git reset --hard "comitID"</strong></code>(here we need to enter the commit id which we want to go back to)</p>
    <p><h2>*  use this when the commits are done on local and not yet pushed</h2></p>
    <p><h3>reset will take you to state of particular commit</h3></p>
    <p>whenever we want to go back to preveous history we can use above given command with this three below given argument</p>
    <p>using <code><strong>( --hard )</strong></code></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Inshort from git history commit will be deleted and also from the current working file to changes will be Undo and yeah it also deletes all the changes which are made but not staged or commited.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>using <code><strong>( --soft )</strong></code></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Inshort from git history commit will be deleted.However, don't make no changes in file aint dont remove the code (It does not touch your working directory) and It keeps the changes in the staging area </li>
    </ul>
    <p>using <code><strong>( --mixed )</strong></code>(this comes bydefault.Sso,we don't have to define it)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Inshort from git history commit will be deleted and It does not touch your working directory, so any modified files remain as they are.However,It unstages any changes that were in the staging area (the index) after the specified commit, but keeps the changes in your working directory.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><code><strong>git reflog</strong></code> : use this command to get back a commit which we removed using reset</p>
    <p><code><strong>git checkout "commitID"</strong></code> : <br>It changes your HEAD to the commit you specified by the commit ID (e.g., b3c5684) <br>You're no longer on a branch, you're now in a detached HEAD state, meaning you are not working on any branch. Any new commits will not belong to any branch unless you explicitly create a new branch.</p>
    <p><code><strong>git checkout head</strong></code> : checkout you to the head (current commit / active stage)</p>
    <p><code><strong>git checkout head~1</strong></code> : takes you one commit before head / one step behind head</p3>
    <h3>If we have pushed code to the remote repo</h3>
    <p>In case of already pushed code we can use :<code><strong>git revert "commitID"</strong></code></p>
    <p>first we need to choose the commitID which we want to revert so what it does is that it creates a new commit remove the code of the commit which we have selected and commit it</p>
    <p>it will not remove commit from the commit history</p>
    <p>to revert multiple commits we can use <code><strong>git revert commitID..commitID</strong></code> : as you can see enter the range of commits and we are better to take off we dont have to do it multiple Times</p>
    <p>there will be multiple commit will be created also and it depends one the number of commits reverted. To avoid that we can use <code><strong>git revert --no-commit commitID..commitID</strong></code> It will put all revert changes in stagging and then use <code><strong>git revert --continue</strong></code> : so there will be only one commit but multiple things done in one step</p>
    <p>all commit changes will be reverted and come in one commit only</p>
    <h3>How to Resolve Conflict in Git?</h3>
    <p>So, when does a Conflict occurs ? when we are combining code of one branch into another branch And A Git conflict happens when two people change the same part of a file, and Git doesn’t know which change to keep. It usually happens when both edits affect the same line or are incompatible. Git marks the conflict, and you must choose which version to keep or combine them. Once resolved, you tell Git to continue.</p>
    <p><code><strong>git merger --abort</strong></code> : to abort the merge</p>
    <h3>What is Stashing in Git?</h3>
    <p>Stashing in Git is a feature that allows you to temporarily save changes that you’ve made to your working directory, so you can switch to another branch or work on something else without committing your changes. It’s useful when you’re in the middle of working on something, but need to save your progress and move to another task.</p>
    <p><code><strong>git stash -m "message"</strong></code> : will stash the changes and you can also create a message to remember</p>
    <p><code><strong>git stash list</strong></code> : list of your stashed changes in Git</p>
    <p><code><strong>git stash show -p stash@{ID}</strong></code> : If you want more detailed information about the contents of a particular stash</p>
    <p><code><strong>git stash apply</strong></code> : To apply the most recent stash without removing it from the stash list</p>
    <p><code><strong>git stash apply stash@{1} or 1</strong></code> : If you want to apply a specific stash</p>
    <p><code><strong>git stash pop</strong></code> : If you want to apply the most recent stash and remove it from the stash list</p>
    <p><code><strong>git stash pop stash@{1}</strong></code> : To pop a specific stash</p>
    <p><code><strong>git stash clear</strong></code> : If you want to delete all stashes</p>
    <p><code><strong>git stash drop stash@{0}</strong></code> : you can delete a specific stash in Git</p>
    <h3>Using git clone ?</h3>
    <p>when you clone a repository, Git will by default check out only the default branch, which is typically called main or master. However, it fetches all branches from the remote repository, but it only checks out the default branch locally.</p>
    <h3>To see and switch to other branches:</h3>
    <p><code><strong>git branch -r</strong></code> : you can see the remote branches</p>
    <p><strong>Another way Or You can say To import the contact branch into your local repository after cloning a repo that only has the main branch </strong></p>
    <p><code><strong>git fetch --all</strong></code> : First, fetch the latest data from the remote repository to ensure you have information on all branches:</p>
    <p><code><strong>git branch -a</strong></code> : After fetching, you can list all branches, including remote ones, to verify that contact exists.</p>
    <p><code><strong>git clean</strong></code> : remove untracked files (i.e., files that are not being tracked by Git)</p>
    <h3>How to Cherry Pick a Commit in Git?</h3>
    <p>To cherry-pick a commit in Git means to apply the changes from a specific commit from one branch to another. This is useful if you want to take a single commit from one branch and apply it to your current branch without merging the entire branch.</p>
    <p><code><strong>git cherry-pick <commit-hash></strong></code> : the command to cherry-pick</p>
    <p><code><strong>git cherry-pick "start-commit".."end-commit"</strong></code> : If you want to cherry-pick a range of commits</p>
    <h3>What is .gitignore file?</h3>
    <p>A .gitignore file is a special file in a Git repository that tells Git which files or directories to ignore when you are staging, committing, or pushing changes to a repository. Essentially, it prevents certain files from being tracked by Git.</p>
