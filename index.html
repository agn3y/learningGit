    <h1>Git and Github</h1>
    <p><code><strong>git add</strong></code> : to add files to stagging</p>
    <p><code><strong>git commit -m "message here"</strong></code>: to commit the change with a detailed text message</p>
    <p><code><strong>git log</strong></code> : to see log of current branch</p>
    <p><code><strong>git log --all</strong></code> : to see log of whole repository</p>
    <p><code><strong>git log -all --oneline : all log in single line</strong></code></p>
    <p><code><strong>git branch</strong></code> : to see list of branch and currently working branch</p> 
    <p><code><strong>git branch "nameHere"</strong></code>: to create new branch</p> 
    <p><code><strong>git branch --delete branch-name</strong></code> : to delete branch</p>
    <p><code><strong>git checkout</strong></code> : to switch branch (multiple use but let's just keep this one for right now)</p>
    <p><code><strong>git merge "branchName"</strong></code> : go to the branch where you want to merge the code with and use comand</p>
    <p><code><strong>git remote show origin</strong></code> : to see with which repo you currently working with</p>
    <p><code><strong>git remote add origin https://github.com/agn3y/learningGit.git</strong></code> : it will connect/set the repository</p>
    <p><code><strong>git branch -M "nameHere"</strong></code> : it will rename the name of branch</p>
    <p><code><strong>git push -u origin main</strong></code> : <br><br>Every first-time we need to use this command after that we will be able to use git push, here "main" is the name of the branch. -u option tells Git to set an upstream branch. It establishes a connection between your local branch and the remote branch, so Git knows where to push or pull changes from in the future. This is the default name for your remote repository. When you clone a repository, Git automatically names the remote repository origin. You can think of it as a shorthand for the URL of the remote repository (e.g., https://github.com/user/repository.git).</p>
    <p>We can push multiple branches using above given command</p>
    <p><code><strong>git clone</strong></code> : to clone repository</p>
    <p><code><strong>git fetch</strong></code> : download the latest changes from the remote repository, but it will not merge or modify your working directory. git fetch gives you the opportunity to inspect the fetched changes before merging them, which can be helpful for reviewing code or checking for potential merge conflicts. after we use this command we need to merge repo by using git merge command</p>
    <p><code><strong>git pull</strong></code> : fetch changes from a remote repository and automatically merge them into your current branch, inshort git pull will auto mate task which is done by fetch and merge</p>
    <p>whenever we use either of them commands we need to define name of the remote repository. something like <code>"origin main"</code></p>
    <p>there is a rule in Git which is not to rewrite or modify history</p>
    <p>when we have made a commit by accident or may be we sometime just want to revert the change which are not pushed on repository yet we can use <code><strong>git reset --hard "comitID"</strong></code></p>
